## Artist’s statement

Your final project folder should include a README.md document in the main folder (projects/project2/final/README.md) 
that contains a brief artist’s statement about your project. This statement should succinctly explain your artistic vision,
the desired user experience, and how you believe you accomplished this both technically and artistically.
This will help when evaluating the level of creativity you have brought to the project.
