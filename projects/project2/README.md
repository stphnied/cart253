## Artist’s statement
The final project being anything we would like it to be means I could use this opportunity to apply the fundamentals of programming (p5js) I have learnt so far and create a visually pleasing yet interactive simulation. I really enjoy giving a backstory and a meaning to my project,therefore, my goal for this one was to make a story-telling simulation where users can explore and immerse themselves in this stargazing simulation. To achieve this goal, I made use of  different classes and mouse interactions to detect diverse interaction between the user and the elements in the scenes. I also implemented my own visuals and a personalized gradient background color and  a background music to simulate a starry night mood. The final result of my project reflects almost exactly what I had in mind for my proposal. Although I did not include everything I had in mind, I prioritized the most important part of my project,which was having interaction and setting up a calming vibe.The biggest challenge was to include the telescope view of my simulation and I am pleased to say that it is well implemented.
I hope to create more fun and interactive projects in the future and explore further more with programming.
